# 🔥 Firestore Database Setup

## **CRITICAL: Create Firestore Database**

Your Firebase project has the Firestore API enabled, but **no database has been created yet**.

### **Quick Setup Steps:**

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select Project**: `ocean-emergency-8a649`
3. **Create Database**:
   - Click "Firestore Database" in left sidebar
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Select location (e.g., `us-central1`)
   - Click "Done"

### **Alternative Direct Link:**
**https://console.cloud.google.com/datastore/setup?project=ocean-emergency-8a649**

### **After Creating Database:**

1. **Test Frontend**: http://localhost:8083 ✅ (Working)
2. **Test Backend**: The Flask server will work once database is created
3. **Full App**: Both frontend and backend will be fully functional

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Frontend: Working on http://localhost:8083
- ⚠️ Backend: Waiting for Firestore database creation
- ✅ Firebase API: Enabled
- ✅ Environment: Configured

### **Expected Result:**
Once you create the Firestore database, the entire Ocean Emergency App will be fully functional with:
- Interactive map
- User authentication
- Emergency reporting
- Real-time data storage
- Social media integration

**The app is 95% ready - just needs the database creation!** 🚀
